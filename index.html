    <h1><b> Trivia Fix! </b></h1>

    <p> Welcome to Trivia Fix! Are you ready to test your knowledge? This game is sure to do just that!
        From the multiple categories, to the timed response times, you're sure to be delightfully challenged!
    </p>

    <h2> Gameplay/ Rules </h2>

    <p>There are five genres that you can test your knowledge in: <ul>
        <li>Geography</li>
        <li>Science</li>
        <li>History</li>
        <li>Pop Culture</li>
        <li>General Knowledge/ Random</li>
    </ul>
        
    There are 10 questions in each category, each worth 10 points. The highest possible score is 100 per round.
    The only exception of this is bonus questions/ rounds in certain situations. Bonus
    questions are also 10 points while bonus rounds have an earning potential
    of 200 points total, each question being worth 20 points. A score of 70 points is 
    the minimum score needed to successfully pass onto the next genre. OH! I'd like to 
    add that on top of the points needed, you must answer each question within a 
    time-frame of seven seconds. Once the timer is up, the question is automatically 
    marked wrong, and the next question is prompted to answer. So try your best to answer 
    the questions in the given time-frame. Based on your total score after playing through 
    all of the genres, you will be ranked on an intelligence scale as follows:
    <dl>
        <dt>Genius</dt>
        <dd> 550- 700</dd>
        <dt>Intelligent</dt>
        <dd> 350 - 550</dd>
        <dt>Average</dt>
        <dd> 150 - 350</dd>
        <dt> Pick up a book...</dt>
        <dd> 0 - 150</dd>
      </dl>
      

 </p>

    <p> There are two play options: One player and Two player. With one player, the playthrough is as follows:
         A genre is randomly chosen for you initially. As explained above, you will have 10 questions to answer, all worth
         10 points. A minimum of 70 points is needed to move on to the next genre. You can quit at any time during your game.
         If you do not score enough points in your round, you can start the round over. If you do get a satisfactory score, you
         can move onto the next genre of your choosing.
