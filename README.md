# Trivia-Fix-game
A trivia game that has one or two player capabilities and intelligence ranking based on scores. I've coded the bare bones of my trivia game using html, css, and javascript.
I have not coded the 2 player functionality. This is something I would like to expand upon, including the wireframing being
completed of how my game should look. There are some features missing, like the ranking and other genres that I also plan to add
later.
